# Brain Stroke and Cardiac Arrest Prediction

##  Overview
This project implements a machine learning–based system to predict the risk of brain stroke and cardiac arrest using patient medical and lifestyle data. The aim is to support early risk detection and preventive healthcare decisions.

##  Objectives
- Analyze patient health and lifestyle data
- Predict stroke and cardiac arrest risk using machine learning
- Compare multiple ML classification models
- Provide a simple risk prediction system

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning (Classification)

##  Dataset
- Public healthcare dataset (Kaggle)
- Features include age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, glucose level, smoking status, etc.

##  Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing (missing values, encoding, scaling)
3. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
4. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
5. Model Saving
6. Risk Prediction

##  How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
3. Train and evaluate the model:
4. Run prediction:

##  Results
The system successfully predicts stroke and cardiac arrest risk. Due to class imbalance, Decision Tree showed better performance in detecting high-risk cases compared to other models.

##  Future Enhancements
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE
- Add probability-based risk levels (Low / Medium / High)
- Build a web application using Flask
- Integrate real-time health monitoring data

##  Academic Note
This project was developed as part of an MCA academic requirement and demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in healthcare.
